                Black Fashion House at once is past, present, and future. It is our responsibility to contribute to beauty in the world and the notion of art as a weapon for change. To see beyond our circumstances and celebrate our common humanity. 

Community, education and culture remain at the forefront of our story and our purpose. In addition to connecting designers directly to consumers and establishing a Black designer directory, our initiatives include supporting future design students with scholarships in all areas of design, fashion, and fashion business. Additionally, mentorship and internships opportunities will be made available to these students with an emphasis on purpose, nourishing potential, and embracing the nuances of our individual voices.

Through Black Fashion House and the support of our members, exhibits, experiential sessions, and lineups of impactful Q&As with designers, entrepreneurs, and cultural figures in Black fashion, both emerging and established, will be held beginning Spring 2021.
