              Black Fashion House is a conceptual retail, educational, and
              cultural experience aimed toward the discovery and furtherance of
              Black designers. Through cultivating retail spaces and
              experiences, Black Fashion House supports the ideas and continued
              growth of Black designers and Black-owned brands.

                Black Fashion House was founded with the mission to discover,
                support and further Black designers and the communities they
                inspire. Our focus on fashion relates specifically to the
                contributions of Black designers and the impact of Black
                culture. We will tell the often forgotten stories of Black
                designers while also documenting and preserving Black fashion:
                past, present, and future.

                Black Fashion House is not exclusionary; it is meant to include
                everyone interested in discovering the contributions and
                influence of Black people in fashion, art, design and popular
                culture. Black Fashion Fair encourages dialogue and gives voice
                to those who have been historically erased from these
                narratives.
